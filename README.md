# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. In this repo you will find, written reports based on our analysis and the visualizations we created.


### Purpose
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was a real challenge setting up the formula for Deliverable 2. It was quite easy to miss a coma, or quation mark and mess up the full formula. I also struggled with setting up the filters for our pivot table. Figuring out which column belongs where does take awareness and a clear understanding of what type of analysis you are trying to make. My biggest strugle or challenge was the date columns. I believe originally I skipped over the module that explained how to convert the unix timestamp to a readable date, but I went back through the modules and was able to find the solution.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaign goals should be aimed to be less than or equal to $1000 or between $30,000 - $40,000. If your campaign goal needs to be more than $1000 and less than $30,000, then I would reccomend running multiple low goal campaigns to increase your change of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are quite a few common limitations to the dataset. Reliability of this dataset plays a huge role, we are not really sure if this is reliable, it may have missing data, or data inputed incorrectly due to human error.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
